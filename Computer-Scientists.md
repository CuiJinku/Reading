## Stuart Feldman

* Stuart Feldman is a computer scientist. He is best known as the creator of the computer software program make. He was also an author of the first Fortran 77 compiler, was part of the original group at Bell Labs that created the Unix operating system, and participated in development of the ALTRAN and EFL programming languages.

## Douglas McIlroy

* Malcolm Douglas McIlroy (born 1932) is a mathematician, engineer, and programmer. As of 2019 he is an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at Dartmouth College. McIlroy is best known for having originally proposed Unix pipelines and developed several Unix tools, such as `spell`, `diff`, `sort`, `join`, `graph`, `speak`, and `tr`. He was also one of the pioneering researchers of macro processors and programming language extensibility. He participated in the design of multiple influential programming languages, particularly `PL/I`, `SNOBOL`, `ALTRAN`, `TMG` and `C++`.

## Steve Bourne

* Stephen Richard "Steve" Bourne (born 7 January 1944) is an English computer scientist based in the United States for most of his career. He is well known as the author of the Bourne shell (sh), which is the foundation for the standard command-line interfaces to Unix.

## Steve Johnson

* Stephen Curtis Johnson (known as Steve Johnson) is a computer scientist who worked at Bell Labs and AT&T for nearly 20 years. He is best known for Yacc, Lint, spell, and the Portable C Compiler, which contributed to the spread of Unix and C. He has also contributed to fields as diverse as computer music, psychometrics and VLSI design.

## John Mashey

* Mashey holds a Ph.D. in computer science from Pennsylvania State University,[1] where he developed the ASSIST assembler language teaching software.[2] He worked on the PWB/UNIX operating system at Bell Labs from 1973 to 1983, authoring the PWB shell, also known as the "Mashey Shell".[3] He then moved to Silicon Valley to join Convergent Technologies, ending as director of software.[4] He joined MIPS Computer Systems in early 1985, managing operating systems development, and helping design the MIPS RISC architecture, as well as specific CPUs, systems and software.[4] He continued similar work at Silicon Graphics (1992–2000), contributing to the design of the NUMAflex modular computer architecture using NUMAlink, ending as VP and chief scientist.[4][5]

He has written and co-written articles and books about programming style, software tools, and the C programming language, as well as works of science fiction.

## Ken Thompson

* Kenneth Lane Thompson (born February 4, 1943) is an American pioneer of computer science. Thompson worked at Bell Labs for most of his career where he designed and implemented the original Unix operating system. He also invented the B programming language, the direct predecessor to the C programming language, and was one of the creators and early developers of the Plan 9 operating system. Since 2006, Thompson has worked at Google, where he co-invented the Go programming language.
